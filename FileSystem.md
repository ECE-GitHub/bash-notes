# Command Line Cheat Sheet

## What this is document and isn't 
This document is a basic guide to getting around the file system of a POSIX (Unix, Linux,
MacOS based system). It is not comprehensive.

It is also geared primarily to POSIX based systems (though Windows 10 users
should note that an Ubuntu command line now exists for it, too!).

## Getting to a terminal
Pulling up a command line terminal varies from operating system to operating system.
On MacOS, the Terminal app launches the command line, whereas various flavors of Linux
will hide it in various places if launched in workstation (graphical) mode.

When logging on to a server or computing cluster via an SSH client (more here), you'll
simply land in a terminal.

Most likely the shell you'll encounter is the one whose commands are described herein,
the Bash shell (Bourne Against SHell), a revision of the older SH. There are
different flavors of Bash, and different Unix-based OSes all have their tics.

## Always use 'man'. Always
One of the most useful commands you should probably learn before even basic
file operations is the most straightfoward -- 'man'

Syntax:

```bash
man <command>
```
It will give a printout of a particular system command's usage 
(or really any program that has manual documentation) to the terminal window 

A shortened version of the output is here:
```
LS(1)                     BSD General Commands Manual                    LS(1)

NAME
     ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls dis-
     plays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For each
     operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of files
     contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated infor-
     mation.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are dis-
     played.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are dis-
     played first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and
     in lexicographical order.
```

Most entries describe the command's basic function, give a listing of its operands
(usually prefixed by -- or -) and then what it takes as an input.

So from that, we learn that ls lists the contents of a directory.

## Getting around the file system

When you first open a terminal, you will probably be dropped off in your home directoy,
often abbreviated by a ~. POSIX systems all use forward slashes to mark directory
structure. (Directories are like the folders you see in a graphical interface.)

For example:
```
/ denotes the root directory
/home/ marks a directory under the directory /
/home/user marks a directory under /home
```

Prompt for my home directory on a server called della is something like this:
```
[bhicks@della4 ~]$
``` 
The $ is just shell speak for 'Ready to start a new command'

Let's look around, shall we? If you see a command here, run its 'man' to get a
full listing. It's habit building. In a good way.

### ls and pwd
`ls` gives you the structure of a directory and its files. 

Without any arguments, it will return any non-hidden files in your current directory.

```
[bhicks@della4 ~]$ ls
output.out  R  R-benchmark-25.R  R-benchmark-parallel.R  Rmpi_0.6-6.tar.gz  submit.cmd
```

This shows me a list of files in the current directory, but not much else.

A useful common set of operands are `ls -al`:
```
[bhicks@della4 ~]$ ls -al
total 248

``` 

This looks like a lot of obtuse information, but it tells me 1) all the files, including
'hidden' dotted files like my .bashrc that helps set initial variables for a Bash sessioni 2) shows size in KB (add -alh to get a more useful set of values there) and 3) the 
permissions of each file, but that's a topic for later.

I still down't know what the absolute file path for the directory is. In this case, 
`pwd` is the ticket. It prints the working directory to the console.

```
[bhicks@della4 ~]$ pwd
/home/bhicks
```

Now I know that ~ is a shorthand way of writing /home/bhicks.

## cd

I know where I am. Now how do I get where I'm going?
