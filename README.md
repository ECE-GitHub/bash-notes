# Bash and Shell Related Materials

This site contains a collection of notes relating to Bash for beginners that I've written.
Hopefully it can be a helpful resource, though at the moment it is primarily incomplete.

## Guides
[Basic file system directory commands - ls, pwd, cd, mkdir](Directories.md)

[Copying and (Re)Moving files - cp, mv, rm](Files.md)

[Input, Output, and Piping - >, \<, |](Input.md)

[Utilities - less/head/tail, grep, sed](Utilities.md)

## Outside links and practice

[command-line-bootcamp](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=nhgk0wnewbk)

Both of the above let you learn and test your commandline skills.
